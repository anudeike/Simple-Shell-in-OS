# Project 1: Simple Shell
The objective of this assignment is to understand the workings of a command-line interface (CLI) and to obtain a working knowledge of process forking and signaling.

Assignment:
In this project we will build a command shell in stages. Our command shell will be a simple implementation of the commonly used command shells such as sh, bash, csh, and tcsh.

The assignment is split-up in tasks to implement separate features of our shell program. The code fragments for these tasks does not need to be separately submitted. Only the final implementation should be submitted for grading. If you are not able to complete the final tasks, you should be able to submit a partial but working shell program.

The textbook discusses a simple shell implementation at the end of Chapter 3. You may use this information as a resource, as well as the labs that we have covered in class.

Project team:
You are allowed to work on this assignment in a team of at most   two  students; but not required.

Submission of source code and report:
Push your code to github, and post a github url in Google Classroom as your submission. You must include a report (two-page minimum) that describes your design choices and documentation of your code. Include your name and your teammateâ€™s name (if you have a teammate) in all source codes and accompanying reports.

Please submit a link to your github repo. You must share your project with me (blegand@gmail.com)  on github.

Do not make your repo public, for obvious reasons until I have finished grading all projects.
